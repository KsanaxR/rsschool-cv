#### Brief information about me

I am a third year undergraduate student at BSTU and I am majoring in IT Software Engineering. Before I entered the university, my goal was to become a full-stack developer, but after the first academic year, I realised that the knowledge that the university was going to give me was not going to be enough for me to achieve my goal. 

>**Why do I need this course?**
>I joined the course to gain more practical skills and to get closer to how developers actually work so that I can integrate better into the working environment after the course as I currently have no professional experience.

###### **My strengths:** 
1. *Communication skills*
1. *Perseverance* 
3. *Patience*
4. *Resourcefulness*

### My skills:
- **Languages: SQL,C,C++,C#,Java,Assembler,JS,TS(React,HTML(Sass,CSS,XML,DOM)).**
- **Development environment, version control systems, web services: Vsc, Vs, Idea,Git, Github,Figma.**
- **Optional: Matlab, Multisim.**

##### *Example c++ code*: 
```
int main()
{
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "Rus");
    vector<int> v{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
    int target1 = 3;
    int num_items1 = count(v.begin(), v.end(), target1);
    cout << "Число: " << target1 << " количество: " << num_items1 << endl;
    int num_items3 = count_if(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int i) {return i % 3 == 0; });
    cout << "Количество элементов, кратных 3: " << num_items3 << endl << endl;

    cout << "Лямбда, захват переменных" << endl;
      for (auto i : v) [i](){ if (i % 3 == 0) cout << i << " ";}();

    cout << "\nЛямбда с параметрами" << endl;
    for (auto i : v) [](auto i){if (i % 3 == 0) cout << i << " ";}(i);

    cout << "\nЛямбда без параметров" << endl;
    for (auto i : v) [i]{if (i % 3 == 0) cout << i << " ";}();

    cout << "\nДополнительно: " << endl;
    auto result = [](string str1, string str2){return str1 + str2;}("Hello, ", "World");
    cout << result << endl;

    return 0;
}

```

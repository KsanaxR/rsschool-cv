#### Brief information about me

I am a third year undergraduate student at BSTU and I am majoring in IT Software Engineering. Before I entered the university, my goal was to become a full-stack developer, but after the first academic year, I realised that the knowledge that the university was going to give me was not going to be enough for me to achieve my goal. 

>**Why do I need this course?**
>I joined the course to gain more practical skills and to get closer to how developers actually work so that I can integrate better into the working environment after the course as I currently have no professional experience.
